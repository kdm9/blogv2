I'm a PhD Candidate in Bioinformatics and Population Genomics in the lab of `Justin Borevitz <https://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au>`__ at the ANU in Canberra. My thesis aims to create novel methods for the analysis of population genomic datasets, and to apply these and other methods to a and investigation of speciation, local adaptation, and hybridisation in Eucalyptus.

Outside science I enjoy woodwork and photography (`you can see some of my photos here <https://birds.kdmurray.id.au>`_).


Why "A Bag of Words"?
---------------------

The `Bag of Words model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model>`_ is the natural language processing term for kmer analysis, which is the main methodological focus of my thesis.
