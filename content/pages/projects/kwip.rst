kWIP, or the k-mer weighted inner product, is a method of estimating genetic distance directly from modern sequencing data.

   :alt: kWIP Overview
   

The paper for kWIP is now published in PLoS Computational Biology (`doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005727 <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005727>`__). We show that kWIP performs well on low-moderate coverage whole-genome population re-sequencing data, accurately estimating genetic distances.

kWIP is open source, and available from my `GitHub page <https://github.com/kdmurray91/kwip>`__.
