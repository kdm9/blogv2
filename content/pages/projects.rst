My PhD
======

I started my PhD in March 2015, aiming to devise and implement methods to accelerate the analysis of population resequencing data. A (frequently updated) summary of my work `is here </projects/phd/>`_.


Bioinformatics Software
=======================

-  `kWIP </projects/kwip/>`__, the k-mer Weighted Inner Product, which
   estimates genetic distance directly from NGS read sequences.
-  `Axe </projects/axe/>`__, a Trie-based sequence read demultiplexer,
   especially useful for GBS data.
-  `SeqHax <https://github.com/kdmurray91/seqhax>`_ is a sequence swiss army
   knife. SeqHax is designed to complement tools like Heng Li's seqtk with
   additional features for low-level sequence file manipulation (like checking
   that all read pairs are correctly paired, or truncating reads at a given length).
